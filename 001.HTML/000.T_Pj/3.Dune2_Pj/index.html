                        <h3>Paul Atreides</h3>
                        <p>In Dune, Paul is the teenage son and heir of Duke Leto Atreides and Lady Jessica, whose family is
                            thrown into the dangerous political intrigues centered on the inhospitable desert planet
                            Arrakis, only known source of the oracular spice melange, the most important and valuable
                            substance in the universe. Paul has been trained by his father and several Atreides attendants
                            in fighting and the art of war, and by his mother in some of her Bene Gesserit disciplines. Paul
                            also possesses burgeoning prescient abilities, which are further unlocked by the inescapable
                            exposure to melange on Arrakis. House Atreides is soon betrayed and scattered, with Leto killed,
                            his forces decimated, and Paul and Jessica forced to flee into the open desert. They are taken
                            in by the native Fremen, a secretive population of fierce fighters who thrive despite the
                            scarcity of water and presence of aggressive, giant sandworms. Paul rises to lead the planetwide
                            Fremen forces against the Imperial stranglehold over Arrakis, ultimately seizing control of the
                            planet and deposing Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV. In Dune Messiah, Paul's empire is challenged by
                            the conspiracies of various factions hoping to destroy him, while a jihad in his name rages
                            across the universe. Children of Dune finds Paul's heirs trying to maintain the already
                            declining empire he has abandoned.</p>

                        <h3>Duncan Idaho</h3>
                        <p>Duncan Idaho is the Swordmaster of House Atreides, and one of Paul's teachers. In Dune, Leto
                            sends Duncan to build a relationship with the mysterious native Fremen of Arrakis, people
                            tempered by the planet's harsh conditions who Leto realizes are an underestimated and untapped
                            resource. Leto allows Duncan, impressed with the Fremen and their ways, a dual loyalty to both
                            the Atreides and Stilgar, but he is later killed helping Paul and Jessica escape the Harkonnens.
                            Duncan is revived by the Bene Tleilax as the ghola Mentat Hayt in Dune Messiah, and works with
                            Paul's sister Alia to unravel the conspiracy against the Atreides. The Tleilaxu have secretly
                            programmed Hayt to seduce Alia, weaken Paul psychologically and then kill him. The trauma of the
                            attempt restores his memories of being Duncan. He is married to Alia in Children of Dune, but
                            she has succumbed to the dangers of her unique birth and become possessed by the persona of the
                            deceased Baron Harkonnen. As Alia becomes more power-hungry and attempts to assassinate her
                            mother Jessica, Duncan spirits Jessica and Paul's children Leto II and Ghanima away. He
                            manipulates Fremen naib Stilgar, a loyal Atreides advisor, into killing him, knowing that the
                            act will force Stilgar to join the rebellion against Alia or be executed by her out of political
                            necessity.</p>
    
                        <p>Thirty-five hundred years later in God Emperor of Dune, a series of Duncan gholas provided by the
                            Tleilaxu have served the seemingly immortal God Emperor Leto II Atreides one after the other.
                            Most of these have been killed by Leto himself, as the serial Duncans, pledged to the Atreides
                            in a time when justice reigned, tend to rebel against the hallmark tyranny and oppression of
                            Leto's rule. The newest Duncan is as disillusioned as his predecessors, and after falling in
                            love with the Ixian ambassador Hwi Noree (who is engaged to Leto), he joins Atreides descendant
                            Siona in her plot to assassinate Leto. He allows them to succeed, and as he dies, Leto reveals
                            that his millennia-long plan for humanity's ultimate survival—called the Golden Path—has come to
                            fruition. Siona and her descendants will be invisible to prescient sight, and the end of his
                            millennia of oppression will spark a mass diaspora of humankind which will come to be known as
                            The Scattering.</p>
    
                        <p>Fifteen hundred years later, the Bene Gesserit become the consumers of Duncan gholas in Heretics
                            of Dune and Chapterhouse Dune. The Sisterhood suspect that the Tleilaxu have implanted the
                            gholas with some secret purpose, and when latest Duncan regains his memories, he agrees. The
                            Honored Matres, a violent matriarchal order with the ability to enslave men using their unique
                            sexual talents, have arrived from the farthest reaches of the universe, wreaking havoc and
                            destruction, and obliterating Tleilaxu worlds. An attempt by the Honored Matre Murbella to
                            sexually imprint Duncan triggers the hidden Tleilaxu purpose: to conquer the Honored Matres by
                            using a better version of their own sexual techniques. All the memories of the previous Duncans
                            are unlocked in the current one as he and Murbella imprint each other. Addicted to each other,
                            they are confined to a no-ship on the Bene Gesserit homeworld, Chapterhouse. There, Duncan
                            trains other men to enslave Honored Matres, until he and Sheeana escape in the untraceable ship.

                        <h3>Chani</h3>
                        <p>Chani is the daughter of Liet-Kynes, the Imperial Planetologist on Arrakis, and his Fremen wife
                            Faroula. In Dune, Paul Atreides sees Chani in his prescient dreams before his family moves from
                            Caladan to Arrakis. Later, Paul and his mother Jessica flee the Harkonnen attack that kills his
                            father and decimates the Atreides forces, and are reluctantly taken in by a tribe of the
                            planet's native desert people, the Fremen. Chani, a fierce warrior, is assigned to protect and
                            guide Paul in the Fremen ways. They soon become lovers, and Paul, now known as Muad'Dib, rises
                            as a military and religious leader among the Fremen. Their rebellion against the Harkonnens
                            intensifies, and Paul and Chani's infant son is murdered in a Sardaukar raid. The Fremen
                            overcome the Imperial and Harkonnen forces thanks to Paul's military strategy, their own
                            ferocity and their ability to use sandstorms and the giant sandworms of Arrakis to their
                            advantage. With his absolute control over Arrakis and the spice, Paul deposes Padishah Emperor
                            Shaddam IV, marrying his daughter Princess Irulan to secure the throne. He vows that Chani will
                            always be his only love, and mother of his children.</p>
    
                        <p>Twelve years later in Dune Messiah, Paul and Chani remain childless. Irulan, Bene
                            Gesserit-trained and doing their bidding, has been secretly feeding Chani contraceptives to
                            prevent her from conceiving an Imperial heir. The Sisterhood are desperate to regain control of
                            Paul's bloodline for their breeding program, and are fearful of the effect Chani's "wild" genes
                            may have on their offspring. But when Chani begins an ancient Fremen fertility diet high in
                            melange, Irulan loses her ability to interfere, and Chani becomes pregnant. Chani ultimately
                            discovers not only Irulan's role in her infertility but the fact that the contraceptives have
                            caused permanent damage and will jeopardize her pregnancy. Chani seeks to kill Irulan, but Paul
                            forbids it. He is secretly somewhat grateful to Irulan, as he has seen through his prescience
                            that childbirth will bring Chani's death, and so Irulan has unwittingly extended Chani's life.
                            Chani dies after giving birth to Paul's twin children, Leto II and Ghanima. Having proven their
                            ability to do so, the Tleilaxu offer to resurrect Chani as a ghola in exchange for control of
                            the empire, but Paul refuses. Through his oracular sight, Paul has seen that Chani's death
                            during childbirth is far less painful and cruel than her possible future fates had she survived.

                        <h3>Baron</h3>
                        <p>The character is usually described as the main antagonist of the novel. Herbert writes in Dune
                            that the Baron possesses a "basso voice" and is so "grossly and immensely fat" that he requires
                            anti-gravity devices known as suspensors to support his weight. He is one of the wealthiest
                            members of the Landsraad and a bitter rival of Leto Atreides, and the Baron's "legendary evil
                            and intellect" are unmatched by anyone else from House Harkonnen. In the novel, the Baron feigns
                            outrage over losing control of Arrakis to Leto but is actually conspiring to use the situation
                            as an opportunity to destroy House Atreides once and for all. William Hughes of The A.V. Club
                            describes the Baron as "a decadent, monstrous gasbag of depravity and evil". As ruthless and
                            cruel as he is intelligent and cunning, the Baron is "crafty and power-hungry" and has a talent
                            for manipulating others and exploiting their weaknesses as well as a propensity for torture and
                            blackmail. IGN describes the character as "cruel, sadistic, and hedonistic". Travis Johnson of
                            Flicks.com.au says that Harkonnen is written as "a predatory homosexual given to pederasty and
                            incest, an unrepentant rapist and murderer." The Baron's sexual preference for young men is
                            implied in Dune and Children of Dune. It is noted, however, that he "once permitted himself to
                            be seduced" by a Bene Gesserit in the liaison which produced his secret daughter.</p>
