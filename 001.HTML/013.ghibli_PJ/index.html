                                    Two young girls, Satsuki and Mei, have moved with their father into a new home in
                                    the country, while their mother recovers from illness in a nearby hospital. To their

                                    creatures and even stranger neighbours - forest guardians that the girls dub Totoro.
                                    When trouble occurs, their new friends will help them rediscover hope.

                                    Set in Yokohama, From Up On Poppy Hill is a high school love story that take place
                                    in the year before the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics. As the country begins to pick
                                    itself up from the devastation of the Second World War, the new generation struggles
                                    to move towards a prosperous future whilst trying not to lose the essence of their
                                    past. The film's rich and vibrant animation captures the entrancing beauty of
                                    Yokohama's harbour and lush surrounding hillsides and, with a soundtrack that draws
                                    inspiration from the finest music of the time, perfectly captures the thrills of
                                    young romance and the hope of a new dawn.

                                    Twelve year old Anna believes she sits outside the invisible magic circle to which
                                    most people belong, and shuts herself off from everyone around her.<br>
                                    Concerned for her health, Anna’s foster mother decides to send her to rural Hokkaido
                                    to stay in a sleepy town by the sea. As she dreams her days away amongst the
                                    marshes, Anna finds herself strangely drawn to the enigmatic house which sits upon
